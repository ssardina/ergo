# EV3 LEGO RObot

This directory contains Python code that can used to create a server that will manage a LEGO robot on instructions from an ERGO program.  It assumes that the EV3dev operating system has already been installed on a micro-SD card for the [EV3 Brick](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/lego-mindstorms-ev3-31313) of the LEGO robot. See https://www.ev3dev.org/ for instructions.

The use of this code with ERGO is described in Chapter 8 of the book.

This directory contains the following:

- `misc/`: Code to test motors/sensors (no TCP)
- `ergo_communications.py`: Code to read/write over TCP
- `test_server.py`: Code to confirm working TCP
- `manager1.py`: Code to confirm motor/sensor TCP control
- `delivery_manager0.py`: Code for delivery robot of Chapter 8

All these files should be copied to the EV3 Brick for execution there.

# Servers

Servers are programs that an ERGO program can interact with over TCP when it is run online.  The idea is that ERGO produces endogenous actions as it running which a server will consume and do something  reasonable with.  Also, the server may produce its own exogenous actions which ERGO will consume and
do something reasonable with.

This directory contains the following:

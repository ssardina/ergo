This directory contains all the Racket Scheme files necessary to run the ERGO
system.  These files are loaded automatically by the file "full-system.scm".
That file will be loaded as a library when "racket -l ergo" is used once ERGO
has been installed.  (See "install.txt" in the "Ergo" directory.)

The full list of files is as follows:

# ERGO

This is a distribution of software that comes with the book [Programming Cognitive Robots](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hector/pcr.html) by Hector Levesque.  It comes with absolutely no guaranties or support. It was first released March 2018 (version 1.5, which conforms with the book).


This directory contains all the files and directions for running the ERGO
system as well as a number of ERGO programs. It contains the following:

* `ergo-sheet.pdf`: A one page summary of the ERGO system
* `System/`: All the system files
* `Examples/`: Some example ERGO programs
* `Projects/`: Three larger ERGO programs
* `Servers/`: Programs to be run in conjunction with ERGO

Each subdirectory will contain its own explanatory `README` file.

The original collection of files was put together on **March 17, 2019**.

This describes how to setup and run the ERGO system.

## INSTALL

This describes how to setup and run the ERGO system.

### INSTALLATION OF RACKET

See http://racket-lang.org/. You can test that things are working with

```racket
> racket -e '(+ 3 4)'
7
```

### INSTALLATION OF ERGO

1. First, put all the files in the `Ergo/System/` directory somewhere convenient, away from user ERGO programs.  On a Mac, a reasonable choice is to create `~/Library/Application Support/Ergo/` and put them there.

2. Then find out where Racket keeps user-defined collections.  It's the first element of "`(current-library-collection-paths)`".

     In Mac:

     ```racket
     > racket -e '(car (current-library-collection-paths))'
     #<path:/Users/hector/Library/Racket/7.2/collects>
     ```

     In Linux:

     ```racket
     $ racket -e '(car (current-library-collection-paths))'
     #<path:/home/ssardina/.racket/7.2/collects>
     ```

     **Note:** if Racket is updated, the version folder (`7.2/` above) will change, so it needs to be updated manually.

4. Create the user `/path/to/collects/` directory from (2) if needed, and a new subdirectory inside it called "`ergo`".

5. Put a file called `main.ss` in the `ergo/` directory from step (3).  It should contain just the following three lines:

     ```racket
     (module main racket
     (require (file "/path/to/implementation/full-system.scm"))
     (provide (all-from-out (file "/path/to/implementation/full-system.scm"))))
     ```

   where the `/path/to/implementation/` is the directory from step (1) above.  

6. Test that ERGO is correctly installed:

     ```racket
     > racket -l ergo -e '(ergo-do :nil)'
         Loading ERGO v1.5 (Feb 2021) in Racket 7.2 ...
     '()
     ```

## RUNNING ERGO

(and do see Chapter 2 of the book)

1. To access ERGO interactively:

     ```shell
     $ racket -l ergo -i
     ```

   From there, the primitive functions like `define-fluents` and `ergo-do` can be used.  Files containing other definitions can be loaded with `include`.

2. To run interactively after loading an ERGO file `myfile.scm`:

     ```shell
     $ racket -l ergo -i -f myfile.scm 
     ```

     Other files can be loaded using "include" within myfile.scm.

3. To load an ERGO file `Examples/lift-table.scm` and then evaluate `(main)`

     ```shell
     $ racket -l ergo -f Examples/lift-table.scm -m
     Loading ERGO v1.5 (Mar 2018) in Racket v6.11 ...
     Loading on demand /home/ssardina/git/soft/agents/ERGO.git/System/ergo-do.scm
     '((grab! r1 e1)
       (lift! r1 1)
       (grab! r2 e2)
       (lift! r2 1)
       (lift! r2 1)
       (lift! r1 1)
       (lift! r1 1)
       (lift! r2 1)
       (lift! r2 1)
       (lift! r1 1)
       (lift! r1 1)
       (lift! r2 1)
       (lift! r2 1)
       (lift! r1 1))
     ```

4. To load an ERGO file `myfile.scm` and then evaluate an expression `expr`:

     ```shell
     $ racket -l ergo -f myfile.scm -e 'expr'
     ```

6. To load an ERGO file `reactive-elevator-run.scm` and run the program `control`:

     ```shell
     $ racket -l ergo -f Examples/reactive-elevator-run.scm -e "(ergo-do control)"
        Loading ERGO v1.5 (Mar 2018) in Racket v6.11 ...
     Loading on demand /home/ssardina/git/soft/agents/ERGO.git/System/ergo-do.scm
     '(down! down! down! down! turnoff! up! up! turnoff! down! down! down! down!)
     ```

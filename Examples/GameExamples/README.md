# Game Examples

This directory contains ERGO programs for game playing as described in Chapter 5 of the book.  These games use BATs as usual, but no programming constructs. They call "`ergo-play-game`" instead of "`ergo-do`".

The directory contains the following:

- `ttt.scm`: The game of TicTacToe
- `pousse-main.scm`: The game of Pousse
- `pousse-bat.scm`: An auxiliary file for Pousse
